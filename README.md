### What is Firebase?
Firebase provides a realtime database and backend as a service. The service provides application developers an API that allows application data to be synchronized across clients and stored on Firebase's cloud.

### What is React Native ?
React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities. [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_Native)

### How React Native works ?
Short explanation about **How React Native Works**.

React Native invokes Objective-C APIs to render to iOS components, or Java APIs to render to Android components. This sets React Native apart from other cross-platform app development options, which often end up rendering web-based views.
